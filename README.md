# gitlab-issues-client

## Problem

I sometimes code on a low powered netbook, having the GitLab web interface up is not ideal for both speed and battery life.

## Solution

An curses style command line app using the GitLab API to show issues and allow basic interaction (add issue, labels, comments, close issue).
